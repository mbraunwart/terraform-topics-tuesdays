# Terraform Topics Tuesdays

Terraform Topics Tuesdays plans to cover a practitioner's level of terraform while steadily targeting more advanced topics.

Current Session Outline:

1. Setup and configuration of Terraform Cloud
2. Deploying resources with a provider (Azure, AWS, Docker, GCP, GitHub, Terraform Enterprise)
3. Terraform CLI (I know this wasn't highly ranked, but it is pretty important to cover before we go deeper!)
4. Configure resources for multi-environment deployments
5. State manipulation (remove, move, import)
6. How and when to build a module.
7. When to scale wide with your Infrastructure Codebase and Workspaces
8. Terraform Functions
9. Integration with HashiCorp Vault
10. Testing your Terraform

Sessions are currently planned to be covered by Matt Braunwart and special guests! If you'd like to cover a topic listed or have one of your own, please let me know!
